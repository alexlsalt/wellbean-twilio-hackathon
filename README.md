# wellbean-twilio-hackathon 

Welcome! wellbean is my submission for the April 2020 Twilio hackathon. It's an app that generates automatic Whatsapp reminders for users to stay in touch with loved ones. Enjoy!

## About

During this period of self-isolation, I realized it's a great opportunity to stay in touch more frequently with friends and loved ones. I thought it would be a great idea to create an app that allowed me to input certain indivuduals and receive automated reminders for when to contact them, based on my own preferences.

I found that just a simple message reminder would help so much in keeping in touch with friends and family. 

### How it works

Run locally, the app is not set up to run on full time requirements. In other words, if a user wants to be reminded 'Daily' to call one of their contacts, the app will send a message about once every 20 seconds.

Below is the timetable for when users would receive Twilio messages via Whatsapp based on their contact frequency settings: 

| Frequency chosen  | Actual time elapsed between message sends  |
|---|---|
|  Daily | one message every 20 seconds  |
| Twice a Week  | one message every 40 seconds  |
| Weekly  | one message every 60 seconds  |
| Every Two Weeks  | one message every 80 seconds  |
| Monthly | one message every 100 seconds  |
